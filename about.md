  The objective of this project is to automatically detect types of 
  accountability in news articles when describing crimes such as shootings,
  using a dataset that was annotated with custom labels for this task. 
  This project is in collaboration with [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/), [Dr. Glik](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/glik) from the UCLA school of public health, and facilitated by [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Research and progress on this task will be described in ongoing posts.
